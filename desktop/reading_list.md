# Reading List & Research

## Books to Read
- "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann (started ch. 3)
- "Staff Engineer" by Will Larson
- "The Phoenix Project" - someone at the conference recommended this
- "Building Microservices" 2nd edition by Sam Newman

## Articles / Links
- https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/ - great reference
- That Stripe blog post about idempotency keys - can't find the link
- OAuth 2.0 simplified - need to re-read before implementing auth

## Research Notes
The CAP theorem doesn't actually say what most people think it says. It's about network partitions specifically, not a general "pick 2 of 3" tradeoff. See the 2012 paper by Brewer for clarification.

Interesting thought from the podcast: "The best architecture is the one your team can maintain at 2am during an incident." Need to keep this in mind for the notifications redesign.
