Voice Memo - Jan 30, 2025

Okay so I just got out of the product strategy meeting and here are my takeaways:

First, they want to pivot the analytics feature from a simple dashboard to a full self-serve reporting tool. This is WAY more scope than what we estimated. I need to push back on the timeline or we need more people.

Second, the mobile app launch is being pushed to Q3. Originally it was supposed to be end of Q2. The design team is still iterating on the mobile-specific flows.

Third - and this is important - the CEO wants a live demo for the board meeting on March 18, 2025 at 9am. We need the permissions feature AND the basic analytics dashboard working by then. No pressure.

Oh also, Sarah mentioned she's going on parental leave starting April 1. We need to figure out coverage for her projects. Set up a knowledge transfer plan. Maybe schedule that for the week of March 10?

Hmm what else... oh right, I should look into that monitoring tool that Jake recommended. I think it was called Grafana Cloud? Or maybe it was Datadog. I'll ask him again at the team lunch tomorrow.

End memo.
