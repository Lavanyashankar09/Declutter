# 1:1 Prep - Feb 11, 2025 at 3pm with Manager

## Topics to Discuss
- Promotion timeline: last convo said "on track for mid-year review" - get more specifics
- Team capacity concerns: with Sarah going on leave, we're going to be short-staffed
- The analytics scope creep: need to align on what's realistic for Q1 vs Q2
- Request: attend GopherCon in July (Chicago, July 7-10 2025). Would need travel budget approval.

## Wins to Highlight
- Auth service migration completed on time
- Mentored two new hires through onboarding
- Reduced CI build time by 40% with caching improvements

## Feedback to Give
- Would appreciate more context on why priorities shift mid-sprint
- The new standup format is working well

## Things I Need
- Access to the production metrics dashboard (still waiting on that ticket)
- Clarity on the tech lead role for the notifications project
